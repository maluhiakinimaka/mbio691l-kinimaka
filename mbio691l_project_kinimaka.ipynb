    "### Summary\n",
    "We expect tropical coral cover to decline globally over the coming century, due to a combination of rapidly warming ocean temperatures and ocean acidification. The file `coral_model.csv` contains output from some ecological-evolutionary simulations predicting changes in coral cover between 2010-2020, and 2090-2100 (see [here](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.07.23.604846v1.full) for details, although this is *not* required reading for this project). The simulations cover around 52,000 sites. 12 different simulation configurations were run, each with slightly different future climate change predictions (due to uncertainty in future warming/ocean acidification). This CSV file contains the following data:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **coral_cover_2020/2100**: Simulation estimates of tropical coral cover averaged across 2010-2020, and 2090-2100 respectively (km $^2$).\n",
    "* **SST_2020/SST_2100**: Mean SST (sea-surface temperature) averaged across 2010-2020, and 2090-2100 respectively (degrees C).\n",
    "* **SST_seasonal**: Amplitude of the seasonal SST cycle, i.e. difference between summer and winter SST (degrees C).\n",
    "* **pH_2020/pH_2100**: Mean pH averaged across 2010-2020, and 2090-2100 respectively.\n",
    "* **PAR**: Benthic Photosynthetically Available Radiation (mol m $^{-2}$ d $^{-1}$ ).\n",
    "* **longitude/latitude**: Longitude/latitude of the site.\n",
    "* **model**: Simulation configuration, numbered 0-11.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Your task\n",
    "#### Part 1\n",
    "Create a public Github repository. Throughout Part 2, track your code development using Git commits and commit messages appropriately. After you have produced your three figures, ensure you have pushed your commits (including the scripts and figures) to GitHub. Create a readme file for the repository, explaining what the scripts do, and how others can reproduce your work.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Part 2\n",
    "Your task is to **visually summarise the output of these simulations** in **three figures of your choice**. The analyses and figures you produce are up to you, but here are some suggestions:\n",
    "* A map showing the predicted percentage change in coral cover over the 21st century, averaged across simulations.\n",
    "* A map showing variability in model predictions across the 12 configurations (e.g. where the configurations closely agree, and where they differ).\n",
    "* A plot showing the predicted percentage change in coral cover over the 21st century (averaged across simulations) as a function of latitude.\n",
    "* A plot showing the predicted percentage change in coral cover over the 21st century (averaged across simulations) as a function of the SST and/or pH change and/or seasonal cycle in SST.\n",
    "* A plot investigating which explanatory variable is most important for predicting the simulated percentage change in coral cover over the 21st century.\n",
    "* A plot showing the predicted percentage change in coral cover over the 21st century (averaged across simulations) as a function of the pH change.\n",
    "* A plot comparing the mean predicted percentage change in coral cover over the 21st century between configurations.\n",
    "* A plot showing the frequency density distribution of the change in coral cover over the 21st century across sites (possibly comparing between configurations or between regions).\n",
    "* A plot showing the change in the [joint frequency density distribution](https://seaborn.pydata.org/examples/joint_kde.html) of coral cover as a function of SST and pH, between the start and end of the 21st century.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each figure should be **exported as a publication-quality image file** (decide whether a raster or vector format is more appropriate) and should be accompanied by a caption of **up to 100 words each**. Each figure should have a file size of _at most_ 5 MB (maps) or 1 MB (all other figure types). There is no need to use any python packages that have not been discussed in this course; you will be assessed on the quality and clarity of your figures and code, *not* how sophisticated your data analyses are. However, if you are confident with statistics and would like to do some basic statistical modelling, you may be interested in the [statsmodels package](https://www.statsmodels.org/stable/index.html) and/or [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/) (there is no obligation to do this, and this will not improve your grade). You may use matplotlib and/or seaborn, or any other (Python) plotting package you choose.\n",
    "\n",
    "Analyses and plotting can be carried out using a Python script (.py) or jupyter notebook (.ipynb). However, if you use a jupyter notebook, please still export your figures as separate image files.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Submission\n",
    "Please submit your work, through a link to the public Github repository, **by 12 pm (midday) on Monday 4th November**. Please email this link to Phil Patton (pattonp@hawaii.edu), CC'ing Noam Vogt-Vincent (nvogt@hawaii.edu) and Lisa McManus (mcmanusl@hawaii.edu). Late submissions will lose 10% of their point value per day, unless you contact us beforehand for an extension.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Grading rubric\n",
    "**A**: You have produced three, high-quality data visualisations in an appropriate file format(s). The visualisations are clear and well thought-out, communicating useful and correct insights into the provided dataset. The code used to run analyses and plot data run without errors, are correct, and are clear to read through comprehensive and useful comments. Code has been made available in a public Github repository, which has been appropriately documented with a readme file. \n",
    "\n",
    "**B**: You have produced three data visualisations in an appropriate file format(s). The visualisations communicate useful and correct insights into the provided dataset, but may have some clarity or accessibility issues (e.g. labels are difficult to read, colour maps that do not distinguish well between data). The code used to run analyses and plot data run without errors, are correct, and are mostly clear to read through comments. Code has been made available in a public Github repository, which has been appropriately documented with a readme file.\n",
    "\n",
    "**C**: You have produced three data visualisations. The visualisations communicate correct insights into the provided dataset, although they may not be completely useful (e.g. plotting a relationship between data without a good biological justification) or clear. The code used to run analyses and plot data run without errors, but may be difficult to read and/or have minor analytical mistakes. Code has been made available in a public Github repository, with some effort to write a readme file.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Academic integrity\n",
    "Please follow the guidelines given in the course syllabus and lectures. You can use any online resources, and you are free to adapt code samples found online for plotting. You do not need to cite these code samples *unless* they are doing something clearly novel that goes beyond the normal capabilities of plotting/analysis packages used.\n",
    "\n",
